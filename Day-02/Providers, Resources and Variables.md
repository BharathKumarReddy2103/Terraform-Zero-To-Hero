**Providers, Resources and Variables**

**Introduction**

Welcome to **Day 2** of the **Terraform Zero to Hero series**. In the previous session (**Day 1**), we covered the fundamentals of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and the importance of **Terraform** in automating cloud infrastructure. We also learned how to **install Terraform on different operating systems**, configure it for **AWS**, and create a **basic EC2 instance**.

Today, we will dive deeper into some of the most **critical Terraform concepts**:

**â€¢	Providers in Terraform:** Understanding different provider types and configurations

**â€¢	Writing Resources in Terraform:** How to define and use Terraform resources

**â€¢	Terraform Variables:** Input variables, output variables, and Terraform variable files (.tfvars)

**â€¢	Conditional Expressions in Terraform**

**â€¢	Built-in Functions** for better scripting

**â€¢	Real-world Use Cases** and best practices

By the end of this session, youâ€™ll have a solid understanding of **Terraform providers, resources, and variables**, which will be essential as we move forward with more complex deployments.

**1. Terraform Providers**

**What is a Provider in Terraform?**

A **Terraform provider** is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with **cloud platforms, SaaS services, and APIs**. It defines **how Terraform communicates with the cloud provider** (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) to create, manage, and destroy resources.

When you define a Terraform configuration, the **first thing you need to specify is a provider**. Hereâ€™s a basic example for **AWS:**

```sh
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

This tells Terraform that we want to use AWS as the **cloud provider** and deploy resources in the us-east-1 **region.**

**Types of Providers**

Terraform categorizes providers into three types:

**1.	Official Providers** â€“ Maintained by HashiCorp (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes).

**2.	Partner Providers** â€“ Maintained by third-party cloud providers (e.g., Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud).

**3.	Community Providers** â€“ Open-source providers built by the Terraform community.

**Multi-Cloud and Multi-Region Terraform Deployments**

**Multi-Region Example**

To deploy resources across **multiple AWS regions**, we use **aliases:**

```sh
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  alias  = "east"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
  alias  = "west"
}

resource "aws_instance" "east_instance" {
  provider = aws.east
  ami      = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_instance" "west_instance" {
  provider = aws.west
  ami      = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

**Multi-Cloud Example (AWS + Azure)**

To deploy resources across **AWS and Azure,** we define **multiple providers:**

```sh
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "aws_instance" "aws_vm" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "azure_vm" {
  name                = "example-vm"
  location            = "East US"
  resource_group_name = "example-resources"
  vm_size             = "Standard_DS1_v2"
}
```

**Why Use Multi-Cloud Terraform?**

**â€¢	Disaster Recovery:** Redundancy across clouds

**â€¢	Cost Optimization:** Choosing the most cost-effective provider

**â€¢	Compliance & Regulations:** Some regions enforce **data residency** policies

**2. Terraform Resources**

**What is a Resource in Terraform?**

A **Terraform resource** represents a cloud infrastructure component, such as an **EC2 instance, S3 bucket, VPC, or security group.**

**Example: Creating an EC2 Instance in AWS**

```sh
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

**Best Practices for Writing Resources**

**â€¢	Use Variables** instead of hardcoded values

**â€¢	Follow the Terraform state management process**

**â€¢	Leverage Terraform modules** for reusable infrastructure code

---

**3. Terraform Variables**

Terraform variables allow us to **parameterize configurations**, making them **flexible and reusable.**

**Input Variables**

**Example: Defining and Using Input Variables**

```sh
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}
```

**Output Variables**

Output variables allow Terraform to **return values** after execution.

```sh
output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
```

**Terraform Variable Files** (.tfvars)

To **override default values**, we use a **Terraform variable file** (terraform.tfvars):

```sh
instance_type = "t3.medium"
```

Run Terraform with the .tfvars file:

```sh
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

---

**4. Conditional Expressions in Terraform**

Terraform supports **conditional expressions** to dynamically control resource configurations.

**Example: Conditionally Enabling Public Access for S3**

```sh
variable "environment" {
  default = "dev"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket"

  acl = var.environment == "prod" ? "private" : "public-read"
}
```

If the environment is prod, the S3 bucket is **private**; otherwise, it is **public**.

---

**5. Built-in Functions in Terraform**

Terraform provides **built-in functions** for string manipulation, lists, maps, and more.

**Example: Using the length() Function**

```sh
variable "subnets" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["subnet-123", "subnet-456"]
}

output "subnet_count" {
  value = length(var.subnets)
}
```

This returns the **number of subnets** in the list.

**Example: Using the map() Function**

```sh
variable "instance_tags" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    Name        = "TerraformInstance"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  tags = var.instance_tags
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**

**â€¢	Providers** define how Terraform interacts with cloud services.

**â€¢	Resources** represent cloud components like EC2, S3, and VPC.

**â€¢	Variables** make Terraform configurations reusable and flexible.

**â€¢	Conditional expressions** allow dynamic infrastructure provisioning.

**â€¢	Built-in functions** enhance Terraform scripting.
